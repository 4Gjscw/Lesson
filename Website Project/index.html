        <blockquote>We want to do a lot of stuff; we're not in great shape. We didn't get a good night's sleep. We're a
            little depressed. Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.
        </blockquote>- <em>Jerry Seinfeld</em>

            <p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps
                vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw
                coffee beans must be <a href="roasting.html" target="_blank">roasted</a> the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="grinding.html" target="_blank">ground</a>, the ground coffee must then
                be mixed with hot water for a certain time (<a href="brewing.html" target="_blank">brewed</a>), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated
                from the used grounds.</p>
            <p>Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed,
                or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation
                and lengthen its shelf life.</p>
